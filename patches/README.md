Commands to make the patches

Keep track of the commands used to make the patches, to make sure we keep the same files in them.

## How to deal with patch conflicts
Patch files are generated by machines, and should not be edited by humans, it will cause errors.

Humans confronted with a conflict between two versions of a patch file should solve the conflict by hand in the code files, and then regenerate the patch file.

Imagine you have a conflict in file Conflict.tsx, which causes a conflict in the corresponding patch file.

Conflict.tsx is in node_modules/matrix-react-sdk, so it is gitignored, so the conflict appears in git only on the patch file.

You have this situation : (timeline is read from bottom to top)
```
* merge conflict between develop_tchap and my-feature-branch !
|\
* | merge of other-feature-branch into develop_tchap
| * commits implementing work on my-feature-branch
|/
* develop_tchap code
```

What you can do : (timeline is read from bottom to top)
```
* merge my-feature-branch into develop_tchap : no more confict !
|\
| * merge tmp-branch and my-feature-branch : solve Conflicted.tsx by hand, then regenerate patch file
| |\
| * | make tmp-branch from develop_tchap, commit develop_tchap's version of Conflicted.tsx
|/ /
| * commit my-feature-branch's version of Conflicted.tsx
* | merge of other-feature-branch into develop_tchap
| * commits implementing work on my-feature-branch
|/
* develop_tchap code
```

When you check out a branch, watch out that since Conflicted.tsx is gitignored, the changes are not applied to it. Conflict.tsx's version is still the one of the previous branch you were at.

To get the version of Conflicted.tsx corresponding to the branch you just checked out, you can recreate it cleanly :
```
rm -rf node_modules/matrix-react-sdk
yarn install --force # recreates the dir, applies the patches.
```
